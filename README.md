<h2>What is the DOT?</h2>

The DOT. is a problem solver made to solve dot-sized problems to solve a bigger equation in the world. We believe that Bigger Problems are best solved at small pieces. 
For us, small problems have the solution to everything. And with everything, the world we believe would be a much better and sustainable place. Currently, the DOT focuses on UAE and is best trying to solve SDG 11 problem within the country as per SDR index report, 2022.
